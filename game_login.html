        <label>The Math Quiz is a review game where 2 people test each other on multipication problems. First, Player 1 chooses two numbers to multiply. then player 2 tries to find the answer. If player 2 got it correct, then player 2 will get a point. If player 2 got it wrong, then player 1 will get a point. Then it's player 2's turn to choose the numbers, and player 1 will have to answer. It goes on like that until one player decides to quit. It is basically like a Review of multipication, except much more fun. </label>
